"""Pickle-based RunGraph load cache for run directories.

The cache file ``run.cache.pkl`` lives inside the run directory alongside
``run.json`` / ``run.db`` / ``nodes.jsonl`` etc.  It is a derived artefact:
removing it is always safe — the only consequence is a slower ``load_run``.

Cache structure (pickled dict)::

    {
        "schema_version": CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION,  # int
        "row_counts": (n_nodes, n_its, n_ots, n_payloads, n_views),  # tuple[int,...]
        "run_graph": <RunGraph instance>,
    }

Consistency check: after reading the file we compare ``row_counts`` with the
current on-disk counts.  A mismatch (stale write, external edit, corruption,
schema bump) causes a cache miss; the caller falls back to a full load and
rewrites the cache.

Design invariants upheld here:
- ``save_cache`` never raises; all exceptions are swallowed.
- ``load_cache`` returns ``None`` on any failure (missing file, unpickle error,
  version mismatch, count mismatch).
- Atomic write via ``tempfile + os.replace`` prevents half-written pickle files.
